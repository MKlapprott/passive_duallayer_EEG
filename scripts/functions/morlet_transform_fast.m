function P = morlet_transform_fast(x,t,f,fc,FWHM_tc,squared)
% MORLET_TRANSFORM: 
%     Applies complex Morlet wavelet transform to the timeseries stored in the 
%     matrix x with size (ntimes x ntimeseries). It returns a wavelet coefficient map 
%     (by default squared)
%
% INPUTS:
%    - x       : (ntimes x ntimeseries) a vector of the timeseries
%    - t       : (ntimes x 1) a vector of times (in secs)
%    - f       : (nfreqs x 1) a vector of frequencies in which to estimate the
%                wavelet transform (in Hz). Default is 1:60Hz
%    - fc      : (default is 1) central frequency of complex Morlet wavelet in Hz
%    - FWHM_tc : (default is 3) FWHM of complex Morlet wavelet in
%                time. Also see morlet_design.m. 
%    - squared : 'y' (default) or 'n'. Flag that decided whether the function returns the
%                squared coefficients (y) or not (n). Squaring represents neural power in
%                the corresponding frequency.
%
% OUTPUT:
%    - P: (x ntimes x ntimeseries x nfreqs), or
%    - P: (nTimes x nFreqs), if ntimeseries = 1
%         A matrix of wavelet coefficients (by default squared)
%
% EXAMPLE:
%    t = [0:.01:1].';
%    f = [5:20].';
%    P = morlet_transform(sin(2*pi*10*t),t,f);
%    Coefs = morlet_transform(sin(2*pi*10*t),t,f,[],[],'n');
